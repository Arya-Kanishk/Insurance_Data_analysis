# Insurance Data Analysis and Statistical Analysis


In this project, we will explore a dataset focused on the treatment costs of various patients. The cost of treatment is influenced by several factors, such as age, type of clinic, location, and more, though information regarding patient diagnoses is unavailable. Despite the dataset being relatively small, the goal is to demonstrate effective methods for uncovering insights and patterns that reveal the underlying factors affecting patient charges.

The primary objective is to develop a regression model that can approximate patient treatment costs. To achieve this, we will conduct a thorough analysis of the available data to identify key factors influencing the charges. By systematically exploring the dataset and identifying patterns, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the variables that most significantly impact treatment costs. Ultimately, this approach will enhance the model's accuracy in predicting patient charges.
Here I am doing an in depth exploratory statistics analysis (EDA) at the Titanic dataset. And all of us recognise EDA is the maximum essential component to construct an awesome Machine Learning or Artificial intelligence Model. The goal of this weblog is to behaviour EDA and statistical modelling at the Insurance Dataset Statistical Analysis.

### Introduction
An overview of the project, explaining the purpose of analyzing patient treatment costs and building a model to predict these costs based on various factors.

### Data
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Description of the dataset used, including the features such as age, clinic type, location, and patient information relevant to the analysis of treatment costs.
•	Source: Kaggle Medical Cost Personal Datasets

•	Columns:

  o	age: age of primary beneficiary

  o sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

  o bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

  o children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

  o smoker: Smoking

  o region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

  o charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
  
### Methodology

The project follows these steps:

#### 1.	Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:

o	Handling missing values
o	Converting categorical features to numerical
o	Feature scaling

#### 2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

o	Understanding the distribution of features
o	Identifying correlations and patterns
o	Visualizing data with charts and plots

#### 3.	Statistical Analysis

o	Hypothesis Testing
o	T-test
o	Chi-square testing


#### 4.	Feature Engineering:

o	Creating new features from existing ones
o	Encoding categorical variables
o	Handling outliers

## Results

The project demonstrates the impact of feature engineering on model performance. The key findings include:

•	Summary of the findings from the analysis and the performance of the predictive model, highlighting key factors that influence treatment costs.
